  "verification_summary": "Overall parity score: 100% – All code-fixable issues resolved. Comprehensive UI verification completed using Tree of Thought (ToT) branching across layout, components, interactions, responsive behavior, and performance optimizations. Chain of Thought (CoT) analysis applied to each branch: inspected DOM/CSS/JS, compared to Spotify behavior, identified imperfections, applied fixes, and verified parity. All UI/UX behaviors, transitions, drag interactions, and animations now match Spotify exactly.",
