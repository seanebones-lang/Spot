🎵 QUICK FIX: Download Real Music

1. Go to: https://pixabay.com/music/
2. Search "sad instrumental" → Download 20 tracks → Rename to track-1.mp3 through track-20.mp3
3. Search "happy upbeat" → Download 20 tracks → Rename to track-81.mp3 through track-100.mp3
4. Place ALL files in: public/audio/
5. Refresh browser

That's it! Now you have real mood-matched music instead of tones.

Alternative quick option:
- Download ANY 6 royalty-free tracks (one per mood)
- Name them: track-1.mp3, track-21.mp3, track-41.mp3, track-61.mp3, track-81.mp3, track-101.mp3
- Copy each to fill the ranges (track-1→track-20, track-21→track-40, etc.)
